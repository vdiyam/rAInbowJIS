This contains the doucmentation part of the project.

## Why this app?

This project is the signup flow for an app called Rearrange. It is a room decoration app designed to assist college students in personalizing their living spaces.

The motivation behind this choice stems from the observation that there is currently a lack of a comprehensive platform that seamlessly integrates room layout planning with personalized decoration recommendations.

College students often find themselves grappling with the challenge of frequent room layout changes, and striking the right balance between creating a cozy yet productive environment can be a struggle.

This app aims to address these pain points by providing a user-friendly interface that not only allows for easy rearrangement of furniture but also offers tailored decoration suggestions, making the process of transforming a living space into a personalized haven much more intuitive and enjoyable for the user.

## Project Structure

After creating a basic Expo app, the changes and additions are organized in the following folders and files:

1. App.js (file)
2. app.json (file)
3. Components (folder)
   - CustomButton.js
4. Screens (folder)
   - WelcomeScreen.js
   - PersonalInformationScreen.js
   - GoalsScreen.js
   - AestheticsScreen.js
   - LocationScreen.js
   - ReviewScreen.js

## Our Process

The crazy 8 sketches helped us narrow down our ideas for the app. The user flow diagram further helped refine our process. Finally, the high fidelity prototype brought to life our vision. It was very helpful to already have in front of us what we wanted the app to look like.

Coding based on the prototype did prove a little challenging sometimes. There were some design and placement choices that we'd made that were harder to implement in code. For example, always having the button at a fixed spot in the bottom left of the page.

However, using our class knowledge and with some help from the internet we were able to code through our sign up flow. We especially enjoyed implementing the goal and aesthetic screen because it was a little different compared to what we'd learned in class. That being said we enjoyed breezing through the personal information and location screens based on the class lecture.

## App Design Details

We chose to stick to some basic colors for our app. Light purple, dark purple and beige. Each screen has a similar design other than the Welcome and Review Screen.

The user has to enter details before they can go to the next page and an error is thrown if not. Our biggest challenge was to keep the style consistent through the different types and various screens of the sign up flow.

All screens allow the user to go from one screen to the other before they have to complete the sign up. The user can change any detail on any screen before they select the 'Sign Up' button on the review screen.
